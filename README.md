# Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN)

-----

## Deprecation Notice

This is the repository and code for the **original** version of HNN, as documented in [(Neymotin, et al., 2020) here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/51214). This version of HNN is **no longer supported** and **no longer actively-developed**.

If you are reading this, **you should switch** to the newest version of HNN, called *HNN-Core*, which is [available here](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core) and also at the [main HNN website here](https://hnn.brown.edu). HNN-Core includes its own version of the GUI alongside many other features of the original.

This repository and code has been left as it is for the purposes of scientific reproducibility. The contents of the original README follows this section.

## About

The **Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN)** is an open-source neural modeling tool designed to help
researchers/clinicians interpret human brain imaging data. HNN presents a convenient GUI to an
anatomically and biophysically detailed model of human thalamocortical brain circuits, which
makes it easier to generate and evaluate hypotheses on the mechanistic origin of signals measured
with MEG/EEG or intracranial ECoG. A unique feature of HNN's model is that it accounts for the
biophysics generating the primary electric currents underlying such data, so simulation results
are directly comparable to source localized data (nano-Ampere-meters); this enables precise
tuning of model parameters to match characteristics of recorded signals.

We are integrating the circuit-level modeling with the [minimum-norm-estimate (MNE) source
localization software](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html), so researchers can compute
MEG/EEG source estimates and test hypotheses on
the circuit origin of their data in one software package. Our goal is to design HNN to be useful
to researchers with no formal computational neural modeling or coding experience.

For more information visit [https://hnn.brown.edu](https://hnn.brown.edu) . There, we describe the use of HNN in studying the
circuit-level origin of some of the most commonly measured MEG/EEG and ECoG signal: event related
potentials (ERPs) and low frequency rhythms (alpha/beta/gamma).

## Installation

Please follow the links on our [installation page](installer) to find instructions for your operating system.

## Quickstart

Just do:

    $ python hnn.py

to start the HNN graphical user interface

## Command-line usage

HNN is not designed to be invoked from the command line, but we have started
[hnn-core](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core), a new Python project that can run
simulations with native Python code. Dipole and spiking data are stored in Python objects
and some plotting functions have been implemented. Future versions of this code (HNN) will
import the `hnn-core` module for running simulations.
