## Part 4 Configure and Run HNN Application
1. Open up a new Ubuntu terminal application, referenced in Step 3 of Part 1.
2. We will now download the source code that starts up the GUI. Paste this command to create a copy of the source code on your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn.git
```
3. Paste the following command to navigate to inside the project in your Ubuntu terminal.
```
cd hnn
```
4. Before we can start up the application, an additional step is required. We have to set up the right configurations for Vcxsrv (downloaded in Part 3) before we can start up the HNN interface. To do so, please paste the following command in the terminal to run the `configure_vcxsrv.sh` script which will automatically handle the configurations for you.
```
./scripts/configure_vcxsrv.sh
``` 
A successful run of the `configure_vcxsrv.sh` script should output the following logs.

5. Now run the following command to start up the HNN GUI.
```
./hnn_docker.sh start
``` 

Your terminal should display the following messages if it successfully started up the HNN GUI.

## Troubleshooting
If you run into the following error while running `./hnn_docker.sh start`

`
docker-machine could not be found.
`
- Please make sure you have gone over the previous steps for installing the docker desktop.
- If this error persists, please try closing and restarting the docker desktop application.

If you run into the following error while running `./hnn_docker.sh start`

`
xauth: (argv):1: couldn't query Security extension on display “:0”
`
- Please double check that you have gone through the steps in Part 3 to correctly set up the Vcxsrv server. Also check that you have successfully ran the `configure_vcxsrv.sh` script from the previous Step 4 of this Part 4 of the installation.
